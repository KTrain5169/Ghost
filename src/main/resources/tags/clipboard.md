Snapper is known to have issues with the clipboard if you aren't using a standard Java distribution.

Both the default Minecraft launcher and ATLauncher use a non-standard java distribution called `java-delta-runtime`. This is a stripped down version of java made by Mojang for Minecraft. It is missing some features that Snapper relies on to function properly.

We recommend using a standard Java distribution such as [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
We would also recommend you stop using the default Minecraft launcher and switch to [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) or the [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app).
