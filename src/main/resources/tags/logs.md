When asking for support, you should include your error logs to help us diagnose the issue.

You can find your logs in the `logs` folder of your Minecraft instance. We will usually need the `latest.log`.

Do not paste the contents of the log directly into your message. Instead, upload your log to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs) and provide the link in your message.
mclo.gs will automatically format your log for easy reading and will censor any sensitive information that may be in the log.

Check [here](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/troubleshooting/uploading-logs) for more information.
