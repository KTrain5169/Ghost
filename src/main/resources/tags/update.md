If a new Minecraft version has released, we are probably working on updating our mods to that version. We will release updates as soon as we can. Please be patient and do not ask for updates.

Updating a mod takes time. Just because a new version of Minecraft has released does not mean that we can instantly update our mods (in most cases).
