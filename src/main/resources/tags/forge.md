Spirit Studios mods will never be ported to Forge or NeoForge. Our mods are made for Fabric and should also function with Quilt.

Maintaining a mod for multiple mod loaders is a lot of work, and we would rather spend the time it would take to maintain a multi-platform mod on improving our mods or creating new ones.

If you really want to use a Spirit Studios mod on NeoForge, you can try using [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector). This is not officially supported by us, and we cannot guarantee that it will work. Do not ask us for support or submit bug reports while using Connector.

We are ok with unofficial ports to NeoForge, so long as the mod is clearly marked as unofficial and the original mod is credited. If you do make a port, please let us know! We would love to see it.
