Spirit Studios mods are most often made for the latest major release of Minecraft. We generally don't create backports as maintaining a multi-version mod is painful.

Please do not ask us to backport our mods to older versions of Minecraft. If you really want to use a Spirit Studios mod on an older version of Minecraft, try porting it yourself.

If you do make a backport, please let us know! We would love to see it.
